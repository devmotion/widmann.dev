DataDeps.DisabledError("DataDeps download disabled, as we appear to be in a CI environment, and the environment variable `DATADEPS_ALWAYS_ACCEPT` is not set.\nIf this is indeed running in a headless CI environment, then set the `DATADEPS_ALWAYS_ACCEPT` environment variable to `true` to bypass the accept download prompt (if you do wish to always accept.)\nIf not, then either unset the `CI` environment variable from true, or set `DATADEPS_ALWAYS_ACCEPT` to `false` for the normal prompt behaviour.")
